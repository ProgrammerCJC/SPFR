To run the code, you should first construct the dataset. 
Each line on your dataset should contains the following information, and then split them by a ","
  1. Bug report ID
  2. Product Name
  3. processed summary, and seperate the words by a space
  4. processed description, and seperate the words by a space
  5. component name
  6. severity level
  7. priority
  8. assignee developers
  9. topic id, which is obtained by TMT
  10.fixed or opened.
  
After generating the dataset, you should split them into 10 small dataset, and named as "ProjectName0" "ProjectName1" ... "ProjectName10".
Using severity prediction as example, you should modifity the L487 string theme = "sample_file"; to string theme = "ProjectName";
